## **Data Backup**

Your setlists are stored in Supabase:
- **Automatic backups** included
- **View/export data** in Supabase dashboard
- **Restore from backups** if needed

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Setlists not loading**
- Check Supabase keys in `assets/script.js`
- Verify database table exists
- Check browser console for errors

### **Can't save setlists**
- Verify Row Level Security policy is set
- Check Supabase API key permissions
- Ensure table structure is correct

### **Drag and drop not working**
- Ensure you're dragging by the **â‹®â‹®** handle
- Check that JavaScript is enabled
- Try refreshing the page

### **Slow loading**
- Supabase has global CDN (should be fast)
- Check your internet connection
- Verify closest Supabase region was selected

## **Cost**

- **Netlify**: Free (unlimited personal projects)
- **Supabase**: Free (up to 50,000 database rows)
- **Your usage**: Well within free limits

## **Security Note**

Your Supabase credentials are visible in the public code, but this is intentional and safe:

- **Anon Key**: Designed specifically for public client-side use
- **Row Level Security**: Database access controlled by policies, not key secrecy
- **Limited Permissions**: Anon key can only perform operations you've explicitly allowed
- **No Sensitive Data**: Your setlist app doesn't store personal/financial information

This is the standard security model for client-side applications using Supabase.

## **Real-Time Sync Testing**

Your app has real-time synchronization! To test it:

1. **Open your Netlify URL** in two browser tabs (or different devices)
2. **Create a setlist** in one tab
3. **Watch it appear instantly** in the other tab (no refresh needed!)
4. **Add/reorder songs** in one tab and see them sync immediately
5. **Check the console** - you should see "Real-time sync enabled"

### **Real-Time Features**

- âœ… **Immediate song additions/removals** 
- âœ… **Live drag-and-drop reordering** syncs to all devices

## **Mobile Usage**
